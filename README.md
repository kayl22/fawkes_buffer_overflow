# fawkes_buffer_overflow

python3 script to perform the fawkes machine buffer overflow on port 9898.

HOW TO USE:
1. git clone this repo => https://github.com/kayl22/fawkes_buffer_overflow

2. change the ip_addr and shellcode parameters and you are good to go
(In the script I give specific msfenom syntax to create a reverse shell shellcode payload)
